Simple applications for algorithmic problems

This repository contains a few brief Java codes that Oliver developed in order to solve small algorithmic problems.

Each file, saved as .java, contains a little problem and a proposed solution to it.

It was developed in Eclipse using Java. Feel free to use the code.
